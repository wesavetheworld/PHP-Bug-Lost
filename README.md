```php
<?php
// include php bug lost
include 'phpbuglost.php';
// other libraries in your code
include 'config.php';
include 'functions.php';
?>
<html>
<head>
    <title>This is a PHPBugLost example</title>
</head>
<body>

<!-- Rest of your code -->

<?php
// set true to show console or false to hide
echo bl_debug(true);
?>
</body>
</html>
```

## Why two versions?

The standard version includes many options that do not need to use continuously. In the lite version have been removed to reduce memory usage and load times in production environments. Use the standard version if you want to use all the features of PHP Bug Lost in development environments. Use the lite version if you prefer the speed and simplicity.
